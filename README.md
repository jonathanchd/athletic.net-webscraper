# athletic.net-webscraper

This was originally written in September of 2022 when my friends decided to run a fantasy league for cross country

Since Athletic.net doesn't have an API, I decided to write some code that could scrape data from races and individual athletes to make scoring quicker and easier

All functions are in functions.py, which include functionalities such as pulling an athletes time from a specific race
